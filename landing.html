            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The match winning probability project using logistic regression and 80.05% accuracy is a machine learning
                model that predicts the likelihood of a team winning a cricket match based on various features such as
                team rankings, past performance, batting and bowling averages, and home ground advantage.</p>

            <br>

            <p>The match winning probability project can be used by cricket teams, coaches, and analysts to gain
                insights into the factors that contribute to winning matches. It can also be used by bookmakers to set
                odds for betting on cricket matches.</p>

            <p>The logistic regression algorithm is a statistical method that uses a logistic function to model the
                probability of a binary dependent variable, in this case, the win or loss of a cricket match. The model
                is trained on a dataset that includes historical data on cricket matches, such as team rankings, player
                statistics, and match location.</p>

            <p>After training the model, it achieved an accuracy of 80.05%, which means that it correctly predicted the
                outcome of 80.05% of the matches in the test set. This accuracy is considered good, but there is always
                room for improvement by using more features, optimizing hyperparameters, or using a different algorithm.
